# Manual NOTES.md Cleanup

Manually analyze and remove completed items from `docs/NOTES.md`.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** Automated cleanup has been disabled due to performance constraints. This is now a manual-only workflow requiring human review.

## Your Task

Perform a manual review of `docs/NOTES.md` and remove items that are clearly completed:

1. **Read the current NOTES.md:**
   - Review all critical items (76-100 priority)
   - Identify items that are obviously completed based on codebase state

2. **Remove completed items:**
   - Delete entire sections if all items are done
   - Keep only pending/active items
   - Preserve the file structure and formatting

3. **Report summary:**
   - How many items were analyzed
   - How many items were removed
   - Brief justification for removals
   - Updated NOTES.md content

**Cleanup Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Features/tasks explicitly completed in code
- ‚úÖ Issues resolved and verified
- ‚úÖ Tests/validations completed successfully
- ‚ùå Keep items that are only partially done
- ‚ùå Keep items with no clear completion evidence

## Example Cleanup

**Before cleanup (8 items):**
```markdown
## 2025-11-01 10:25 - [NEXT]
- ‚≠ê95 Test New Format - Start a new session to see compact format
- ‚≠ê85 Update Parser Regex - Implement simplified pattern

## 2025-11-01 10:30 - [NEXT]
- ‚≠ê90 Test Background Cleanup - Verify automatic cleanup works

## 2025-11-01 10:36 - [DEBT]
- üî¥85 JSON Parsing Fragility - Script extracts .result field

## 2025-11-01 10:43 - [TEST]
- ‚≠ê95 Switch to Codex CLI - Update cleanup script
```

**After cleanup (2 items):**
```markdown
## 2025-11-01 10:25 - [NEXT]
- ‚≠ê85 Update Parser Regex - Implement simplified pattern
```

**Removed (6 items):**
- Test New Format (‚úÖ verified working in production)
- Test Background Cleanup (‚úÖ tested, found non-functional)
- JSON Parsing Fragility (‚úÖ no longer relevant after Codex switch)
- Switch to Codex CLI (‚úÖ completed this session)
