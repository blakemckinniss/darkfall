## Command Organization

Commands are organized into subdirectories by category:

- `audit/` - Code quality and analysis commands
- `game/` - Game-specific entity and content commands
- `maintenance/` - Project maintenance and health checks
- `workflow/` - Development workflow automation

---

## Creating Custom Commands

To create a new slash command:

1. Create a `.md` file in the appropriate category directory
2. Add frontmatter with `argument-hint` and `description`:
   ```markdown
   ---
   argument-hint: [your-args]
   description: Brief description of what this does
   ---

   # Your Command Title

   Detailed instructions for Claude...
   ```
3. The command will be available as `/category:command-name`

For top-level commands (like `/next`, `/debt`, `/doc`, `/all`), place the `.md` file directly in the `commands/` directory.

---

## Pro Tips

- **Use `/all` for bulk operations** - Execute entire sections with one command
- **Use focused commands** - `/next`, `/debt`, `/doc` for granular control
- **Chain commands** - Run multiple slash commands in sequence when needed
- **Combine with MCP tools** - Slash commands work great alongside Serena, Zen, and other MCP tools
- **Create project-specific commands** - Add commands that match your team's workflow
